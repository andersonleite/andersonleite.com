<strong>This is the second part of 3 blog posts on how to develop User Interfaces
using RxJS and Cycle.js.</strong>
<br><br>

This is the 2rd part of a blog post series about RxJS and Cycle.js.

<br><br>

Let's continue to build our UI, that consumes an public API from Brewdog's beer.

<b>Cycle.js in general</b>
<br><br>

I'm definitely not the best one to describe <span>Cycle.js</span>, but I can give you an overview and point you some resources to learn more
about the framework. First, I saw some comparisons between RxJS and Cycle. In my understanding, you should compare Cycle.js with
React or Angular.
<br><br>

Cycle.js will provide you a base scaffold on how to handle the interactions between your UI components and the logic
or effects that they should run.

<b>The main function and the drivers</b>
<br><br>

Before we jump to our beer catalogue app, let's explore a simple implementation of Cycle.app.
<br><br>

The idea is to integrate whatever inputs your application has with expected effects/outputs.
In the middle of that, you will have Observers generating streams, as we saw in the the previous post.
<br><br>

Cycle.js will use a simple template language...(in fact it's only javascript, an internal implementation of hyperscript as
I could understand so far) to let you write the view of your UI components.
<br><br>

Take a look at a simple example of a Cycle.js application. We will use this structure to improve the Brewdog's catalogue.

<br><br>

Cycle.run comes from the framework and expect a main function and drivers.
The best way to learn this part in deep is to watch the <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/cycle-js-fundamentals">Cycle.js course on egghead.io</a>.
<br><br>

Now that we have an idea on how Cycle.js works and also played a little with RxJS, let's merge them together.
